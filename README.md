# Legal-Case-Summarizer


Empower legal professionals with quick insights by generating concise and accurate summaries of legal documents through abstractive summarization. Our tool leverages state-of-the-art pretrained models, including Legal Pegasus, Legal LED, and DistilBART, to ensure effective text processing and optimization of summarization performance.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art pretrained models (Legal Pegasus, Legal LED, DistilBART) for effective text processing.
- Implements diverse approaches (chunking, sentence ranking, POS tagging, similarity) to optimize summarization performance.
- Evaluation metrics (BLEU, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROUGE) ensure summary quality.
- Enables legal professionals to make well-informed decisions efficiently.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
